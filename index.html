<p>Camels are easily recognized by their iconic humps.
     Their ability to endure long periods without water is caused by a series of physiological adaptations</p>



    <h1>=>           2.CHAMELEON</h1>
<a href="https://origami.me/chameleon/"><img src="2.jpg" width=300 hieght=300/> MAKE them</a>
<p>Their hands and feet have large toes that help them cling to branches. 
    Besides changing skin color, chameleons have another feature that no other animals have.
     Their eyes can move independently of each other, enabling them to look in two different directions at once.</p>



<h1>=>           3.PANDA</h1>
<a href="https://origami.me/panda/"><img src="3.jpg" width=300 hieght=300/>  MAKE them</a>
<p>Pandas can grow up to 1.5m long and weigh as much as 150kg.
     And while their large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles are designed for crushing bamboo, they can deliver a very nasty bite. 
    In addition, giant panda are excellent climbers, with cubs able to clamber up trees when they are just 6 months old.</p>



    <h1>=>           4.PIGEON</h1>
<a href="https://origami.me/pigeon/"><img src="4.jpg" width=300 hieght=300/>  MAKE them</a>
<p>They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal 'magnetic compass'.
     A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions. 
    Pigeons are highly sociable animals.</p>



<h1>=>           5.BEAR</h1>
<a href="https://origami.me/teddy-bear/"><img src="5.jpg" width=300 hieght=300/>  MAKE them</a>
<p>Bears are not mean or malicious; they are very gentle and tolerant animals.
     Mother bears are affectionate, protective, devoted, strict, sensitive and attentive with their young. 
    Not unlike people, bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful, playful, social and even altruistic.</p>



<h1>=>           6.FLING CICADA</h1>
<a href="https://origami.me/flying-cicada/"><img src="6.jpg" width=300 hieght=300/>  MAKE them</a>
<p> the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). 
    They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha,[a] along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. 
    The superfamily is divided into two families, Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 3,000 species described from around the world; many species remain undescribed.</p>
